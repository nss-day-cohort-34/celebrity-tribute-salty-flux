                   Dave Chappelle is an American stand-up comedian, actor, writer, and producer. Chappelle is the recipient of numerous
                  accolades, including two Emmy Awards and two Grammy Awards. In 2003, he became known for his sketch comedy television 
                 series, Chappelle’s Show, co-written with Neal Brennan. By 2006, Chappelle was called “the comic genius of America”
                 by Esquire and, in 2013, “the best” by a Billboard writer. Comedy Central ranks him No. 43 in “the 100 Greatest 
                  Stand-Ups of All Time.” This multi-faceted performer has made a name for himself in the comedy world as one of the 
                     funniest, raunchiest, and most controversial comics on the scene.
