        <h2 class="dave_bio">BEGINNING</h2>
        <img class="dave_img" src="chappelle_standup.jpg" width="250" height="250">
        <p class="p1">David Khari Webber Chappelle was born August 24, 1973, in Washington, D.C. Chappelle's mother and father were professors. Chappelle began splitting time at his parents' homes in Washington, D.C. following their divorce when he was six years old. </p>
        <p>Inspired by comedian Bill Cosby's sitcom, <i>The Cosby Show</i>, Chappelle knew he wanted a career in comedy. 
        He began his career as a stand-up comedian while attending high school at the Duke Ellington School of Arts in Washington, D.C. 
        His mother would often be required to accompany him to gigs because he was still a minor.</p>
        <br>
        <p><em>NOTE: As of the very moment of this presentation, Mr. Chappelle was only inspired by Bill Cosby's television and not
            his drink-mixing and/or couching.</em></p>

        <h2 class="biggums">BIGGUMS</h2>
        <img class="dave_img2" src="chappelle_big.jpeg" width="225" height="225">
        <p>Unlike crack rock consumption artist, Tyrone Biggums, Chappelle is not a crackhead. His ability to portray Biggums is just a testimony to his high degree of talent.
